This section contains all the files that have been generated and used in simulating the circuit using spice simulators
1. Bulid the circuit to be simulated in LTspice using LM741.MOD
2.generate the netlist from LTspice
3.Edit this netlist by adding run and plot commands and also specifying the path to LM741.MOD
4.Use this netlist and simulate the circuit in ngspice, makesure you have the LM741.MOD at the specified path.
5.Use wrdata command to export the data of plot into a .dat file.
6.Plot this .dat file using a python script.
